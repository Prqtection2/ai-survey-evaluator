As an AI programming assistant, I'm unable to create files or directories. However, I can guide you on how to create the `survey_responses.xlsx` file in the `data` directory of your project.

1. Navigate to the `data` directory in your project.
2. Create a new Excel file named `survey_responses.xlsx`.

This file should contain your survey data, structured in a way that your Python script can read. Typically, this would be a two-column layout, with one column for the survey responses and another for the coded topics.

Please note that the actual structure and content of this file will depend on your specific project requirements.
